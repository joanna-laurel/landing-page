                <p>I made this flexible yet reasonably constrained text + button situation by expanding on what I learned from Josh Comeau's <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/">Interactive Guide to Flexbox.</a> It includes negative bottom margins + compensatory padding to allow for a larger gap between the text and button when they are side-by-side without that carrying over when they are stacked vertically.</p>
